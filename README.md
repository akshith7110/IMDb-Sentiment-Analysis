## My Approach
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Converted text to lowercase  
- Removed HTML tags and punctuation  
- Removed common English stopwords  

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Transformed the cleaned text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)  

### 3. Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) with LinearSVC
